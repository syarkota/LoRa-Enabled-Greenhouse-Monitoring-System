# LoRa-Enabled-Greenhouse-Monitoring-System
This project implements a LoRa-based greenhouse monitoring system using ESP8266 microcontrollers. The system monitors environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, gas levels, and UV intensity, transmitting the data wirelessly using LoRa communication.
